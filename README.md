# WebServicesProject
My final Project for the IT325 Web Services course this semester consists of a RESTful API developed using Python, JWT, FastApi, and MongoDB
I have also used technologies such as Insomnia, VSCode, and GitHub to test, edit and publish this project.
This project contains all the CRUD Operations, secured with JWT token authentication. 
The project's goal is to create a platform for users, especially employees within a company where they can manage their tasks efficiently and stay updated with the goals of the company
Its main function is creating, updating, or deleting tasks by users.
